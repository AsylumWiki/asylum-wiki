# Visa Information

[[toc]]

## Entering Another Country with a Legal Visa

Many countries consider the applicant's visa history when reviewing visa applications. Therefore, holding a visa from any developed country is advantageous. Recent visas from developed countries like South Korea and Japan are especially helpful.

- If you are from Shandong, it is more convenient to apply for these visas, especially since Qingdao offers many weekend travel opportunities.
- Residents of Shanghai find it relatively easier to obtain a Japanese visa.
- If you have no visa history, a large number of entry and exit records can also demonstrate your financial capability.
  - If you are a resident of Guangdong, especially Shenzhen, frequent travel across the China-Hong Kong border may help improve the success rate of applying for European and American visas.
- Jeju Island in South Korea does not require a visa, as it is visa-free, so it cannot be counted.

## Border Management

Some countries outsource border management to neighboring countries, while others require applicants to apply in the first country they enter after leaving their home country.

- Europe has the [Dublin Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Regulation), which is enforced differently in various countries.
- Between Canada and the United States, there is the [Safe Third Country Agreement](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/agreements/safe-third-country-agreement.html).

## Tourist Visa Application

The review time often depends on personal circumstances and the completeness of the materials, as well as the peak and off-peak travel seasons.

Many countries' official websites provide estimated waiting times for different embassies/consulates.

In some countries, you can expedite the process by calling or emailing.

Some embassies and consulates have long waiting times, so please consider booking an appointment in advance. This waiting time is not included in the general visa issuance times below. For example, the Schengen area, the United States, and Canada often have long waiting times.

Most countries require bank statements and proof of deposits. Students can provide proof of enrollment.

## Study Visa Application

Similar to a tourist visa, the waiting time in spring is often longer because it is for autumn enrollment.
