Most countries recognize sexual identity and sexual orientation as recognized fear of persecution[^1], but some countries still do not recognize it, so please double-check whether the destination country recognizes it.

At the same time, taking Canada as an example, refugees are divided into "Convention refugees" and "protected persons". Sexual orientation and identity are within the scope of Convention refugees[^2], but at the same time, due to the dangerous consequences that transgender people and other sexually diverse groups may face, they may also be included in the definition of protected persons.
